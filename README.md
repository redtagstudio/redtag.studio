# Simple website for [redtag.studio](https://redtag.studio)

> Website was developed in 2018 by blacktag.digital. In 2023 was converted from simple PHP app to static page built using [Astro](astro.build).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/ -> Legacy images, legacy vendor js
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets/ -> Legacy css/js files
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ img -> Place new images here and use `Image` component with `getImage` for building `srcset`.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ DefaultLayout.astro -> Layout for a default page.
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ CaseLayout.astro -> Layout for a case study. Extend it for case studies.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ *.astro
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
